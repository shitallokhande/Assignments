        "   whereas Global variables names should start with a capital letter (e.g. GlobalData). \n",
        "   Constant names should be formed using capital letters only (e.g. CONSDATA).\n",
        "\n",
        "- Indentation:\n",

        "\n",
        "- Error return values and exception handling conventions:\n",
        "   All functions that encountering an error condition should either return a 0 or 1 for simplifying the debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Code should be well documented:\n",
        "   The code should be properly commented for understanding easily. Comments regarding the statements increase the understandability of the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Avoid using a coding style that is too difficult to understand:\n",
        "   Code should be easily understandable. The complex code makes maintenance and debugging difficult and expensive.\n",

        "- Length of functions should not be very large:\n",
        "   Lengthy functions are very difficult to understand. \n",
